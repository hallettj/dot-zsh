# dot-zsh

**This is outdated** - my shell configurations have moved to:
- https://github.com/hallettj/home.nix/tree/main/home-manager/features/zsh
- https://github.com/hallettj/home.nix/tree/main/home-manager/features/nushell

This is my zsh configuration.  It is managed with [homeshick][], which
creates symlinks from the appropriate locations in my home directory.
Installing dependencies, compiling, and other setup tasks are handled
using [Ansible][], which runs the steps listed in `init.yml`.
